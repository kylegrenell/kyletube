# React Video Sharing Website

Using jsx, es6, webpack and react

Continued practice for refactoring and understanding the changes from vanillaJS to es6! Lots of comments, but clean code (hopefully!)

To use:

npm install
npm install --save lodash

This app also uses a youtube API key, if there's any issues running the App you can generate your own key here: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started
and replace the API_KEY located in index.js
